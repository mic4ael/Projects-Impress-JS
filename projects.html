            Thanks to my engagement into the subject of Operating Systems,
            my lecturer asked me, whether I wanted to write a program concerning
            basic algorithm problem, so-called Producer-Consumer Problem.
            That was my first, major attempt to write a program with GUI using
            Win32 API.

            Once, during my SQL lectures, the lecturer had put 
            forward an offer for students. The goal was to solve a 
            group of mathematic problems using only SQL. 
            Not only have I learned a lot about SQL, 
            but also was excused from the final exam.

                One of the simplest cryptographic ciphers is Vigener'e cipher.
                In order to facilitate my friends encoding and decoding process,
                I had written a small JS app which visualizes how the cipher works.

                Once upon a time every programmer has a craving to write
                a game. That is the situation I have got through as well.
                I had writted a game that everyone can play with friends
                over local network. Just setup a server and <b> draw! </b>
                The goal of the game is to guess what another player draws.

                About 6 months ago, together with a friend I have created
                a webapp which could help a small company to manage its
                offer, by providing means to store products, customers,
                generate invoices, etc.

            There is also one <strong> python </strong> script I had written
            during a sleepless night. I learn english vocabulary by means of
            Anki flashcards. However, checking word's translation and 
            entering it into the program's database one by one can be
            very tedious. That is why I had written a script which automates
            this process. Simply, it sends a HTTP request to one of the
            translation websites, and then analyses response in search of
            HTML element which probably can hold the translation. Finally, it
            writes all the definitions into a file in specific format.
